This document proposes a shortlist of community projects and outlines local organisations in Brisbane that could become partners for **Atlas Unite**.  Each project is grounded in existing community programs or pressing local needs.  Citations from official sources and non‑profit websites are included to support the information.

## 1 Proposed projects for Locals Unite

| Project | Summary & local context (Brisbane) | Rationale/fit with Atlas Unite |
|---|---|---|
| **Bushcare & habitat restoration** | Brisbane City Council’s **Habitat Brisbane** program supports 150 bushcare groups that restore bushland, parks, wetlands and waterways【680150545599407†L45-L59】.  Volunteers undertake weed removal, plant native vegetation, mulch, conduct flora‑ and fauna‑surveys and host community planting days【74546200158742†L61-L78】. | Adopting a local bushcare site would allow Atlas Unite members to work alongside experienced groups, offer hands‑on environmental action and quickly show tangible results.  Citizen‑science activities also provide opportunities to involve remote volunteers via data analysis and AI‑assisted monitoring. |
| **Creek & catchment care** | The **Creeks Catchments** program works with 12 community‑based catchment groups to improve the health of local waterways【74546200158742†L82-L93】.  The **Brisbane Catchments Network (BCN)** unites these groups and provides a unified voice and collaborative opportunities for maintaining and restoring creeks and the Brisbane River【334808234166099†L30-L45】. | Locals Unite could partner with a specific catchment group to organise litter‑clean‑ups, riparian planting or water‑quality monitoring.  This partnership aligns with Atlas Unite’s environmental focus and fosters collaboration with established community volunteers. |
| **Community gardens & urban agriculture** | Community gardens are open spaces where residents meet, learn and grow produce; Brisbane City Council supports more than 30 gardens and provides guidance, grants and workshops【495894338867347†L31-L134】.  Starting a garden requires a concept plan, management plan and risk assessment【495894338867347†L64-L132】. | Creating or supporting a community garden in a suburb like West End or New Farm would enhance local food security, build community connections and offer educational workshops.  AI tools could help design layouts, schedule planting and optimise crop rotation, leaving volunteers to focus on mentoring and social interaction. |
| **Land for Wildlife stewardship** | The **Land for Wildlife** program helps landowners conserve and restore wildlife habitat【264930948317492†L25-L37】.  More than half of Brisbane’s flora and fauna occurs on private land【264930948317492†L25-L29】; participants receive advice on revegetation, species identification and habitat conservation【264930948317492†L31-L37】 and access free plants, nest boxes and management plans【264930948317492†L66-L77】. | Locals Unite could recruit volunteers to assist participating property owners with planting days, weed removal and wildlife monitoring.  This program builds relationships with rural landholders and contributes directly to biodiversity conservation. |
| **Citizen‑science and biodiversity monitoring** | Habitat Brisbane groups encourage citizen‑science projects and flora and fauna surveys【680150545599407†L54-L59】.  BCN runs initiatives such as the *Brisbane’s Big Butterfly Count*. | Atlas Unite could host bio‑blitz events or support ongoing monitoring efforts (e.g., butterfly surveys, koala drinker trials).  AI can assist in species recognition and data analysis, complementing human observations. |
| **Homeless support & food distribution** | **Community Friends** is a South Brisbane charity that provides food, clothing and blankets to homeless and disadvantaged people; they gave away tens of thousands of meals each year【78463998971412†L22-L29】.  The group aims to improve physical and mental wellbeing and prevent homelessness by providing food and supportive services【78463998971412†L39-L49】. | Partnering with Community Friends would allow Locals Unite to address social inequity.  Volunteers can help cook meals, assemble care packages and distribute food at weekly stalls or deliver to people in boarding houses【78463998971412†L89-L100】.  AI could streamline logistics (stock management, volunteer scheduling) so human effort focuses on service delivery and empathy. |
| **Street outreach & social connection** | **Rosies – Friends on the Street** provides friendship and unconditional acceptance to people who are homeless or socially isolated【399181963319091†L50-L58】.  Rosies’ mission is to ensure no Queenslander feels disconnected; they run outreach schedules across Brisbane and emphasise conversation and hospitality【399181963319091†L50-L68】. | Locals Unite volunteers can join Rosies’ outreach shifts to serve hot drinks and chat with patrons.  The emphasis on connection aligns with Atlas Unite’s goal of building community solidarity, and AI can assist with roster coordination or training modules. |
| **Justice & inclusive community initiatives** | **Micah Projects** is a Brisbane not‑for‑profit dedicated to creating justice and responding to injustice.  It helps people access housing, healthcare, safety, justice and meaningful connection【876735728051785†L86-L89】.  Micah believes every child and adult has the right to a home, healthcare, education and dignity and provides integrated support and advocacy services【876735728051785†L119-L128】. | Atlas Unite could collaborate with Micah Projects on supportive housing drives, social enterprise ventures or advocacy campaigns.  Volunteers might assist with community events or training workshops, and AI can help track resource needs or match volunteers to tasks. |
| **Corporate & online volunteering projects** | Research shows that 71 % of consumers expect companies to be socially responsible and 82 % of employees want their employers to provide corporate volunteer opportunities【698113926474744†L142-L156】.  At the same time, 18 % of formal volunteers now serve online【698113926474744†L117-L128】. | Locals Unite could design short‑term corporate volunteering packages—such as creek clean‑ups or community‑garden working bees—to engage local businesses.  AI tools can match corporate teams with suitable projects and create remote volunteering tasks (e.g., data entry, online mentoring) to include those who cannot attend in person. |

## 3 Considerations for implementation

- **AI integration** – The website should host a forum and project‑pitching tool that uses AI to moderate content, match volunteers to projects and manage logistics (scheduling, resource allocation).  AI can summarise discussion threads, triage flagged posts and help produce progress reports.  This reduces administrative load and allows volunteers to focus on meaningful work.
- **Community partnerships** – Collaboration should be formalised through memoranda of understanding (MOUs) detailing shared goals, resource commitments and data‑sharing arrangements.  Partners may bring specialised expertise (e.g., catchment ecology, homelessness support) and established networks that can accelerate Atlas Unite’s impact.
- **Sustainability and diversity** – When planning projects, consider accessibility for volunteers of different ages and abilities.  Provide remote participation options (online data entry, design work) to engage volunteers who cannot attend physically, aligning with the growing trend of virtual volunteering【698113926474744†L117-L128】.  Partnerships with organisations serving diverse communities (e.g., Micah Projects, Rosies) will help ensure inclusivity.
- **Funding and grants** – Explore community grants (e.g., Community Conservation Assistance offers up to $20 000 in resources for eligible projects【74546200158742†L116-L126】) and corporate sponsorships.  Corporate volunteering interest can be leveraged to secure in‑kind donations and financial support【698113926474744†L142-L156】.

These proposed projects and partners provide a foundation for **Locals Unite** to begin enacting positive change in Brisbane.  By collaborating with established organisations and leveraging AI tools, Atlas Unite can create scalable, inclusive and impactful initiatives that align with its mission.
