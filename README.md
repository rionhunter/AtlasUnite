# Atlas Unite

From cleaning up creeks to raising funds, and helping others in need, those who are able to donate their time towards something they believe in are the life and blood behind positive change in the world. However, the difference that’s being made, while amazing, is evidently still not enough. There are many people who want to contribute to greater things, but the ways in which we can give is too limited, especially given what modern technology and communication can allow.

In providing the tools to empower these people, their skills and their interests, Atlas Unite hopes to help change the perceptions around volunteering. If the concept of donating one’s time wasn’t reserved for altruistic saints, but instead considered a norm, many of the problems that we struggle with today simply wouldn’t exist.

This organisation approaches such broad goals by operating in divisions that have an individual focus, varying from arts, industry, humanitarian needs to planetary aid. Atlas ‘Unite’ is merely the encompassing name for the collection of these divisions. We’ll be launching with just three branches (listed below), expanding as the organisation is deemed ready.

Atlas Ink:  A platform for writers, photographers, artists, graphic designers, editors and even proofreaders to come together to collaboratively create novels, textbooks, comics, magazines and ePublications, with proceeds going to an elected cause.

Atlas Telamon:  With seven sub-divisions, Atlas Telamon focuses on helping and improving local communities, with events held in cooperation with other charities and causes, empowering people to make a physical difference to the world in their immediate vicinity.

Atlas Index:  The internal admin team maintaining and expanding Atlas Unite as a whole.

By operating in fragments across the expansive range of human involvement, we can provide avenues for every individual’s strengths to make a difference, maximising the accomplishment of each volunteer, while ensuring the quality of our services aren’t jeaporadised.

With a strong impetus towards maintaining a fostering, inviting culture and environment for our volunteers, with visible correlation between contribution and results, and through providing a way in which a person’s own goals can be harnessed for good, Atlas Unite hopes to inspire as much happiness as possible, inside the organisation, and out.

This is also reflected in how Atlas Unite will cooperate with other charities and organisations, ensuring they have the facilities, equipment and volunteers they need to achieve their own missions. It’s not about Atlas Unite being responsible for the positive change, but ensuring the positive change is able to happen, through whatever means.

We hope to garner support from local communities and charities, as we will be able to provide so much in return. Atlas Unite has the potential to be the platform that sees charities, causes, organisations, businesses, families, friends and individuals come together for humanity's betterment.
